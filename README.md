# BACKEND 2.0 YouTube Backend & Real-Time Uber-like Tracker

Welcome to the repository! After taking a break from backend development for several months, I've restarted my journey, and this project represents a significant milestone. Here, I have built a complete YouTube-like backend and developed a real-time tracker (similar to Uber) using `socket.io`.


## Youtube Backend

- User Authentication: Full login and registration system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Video Management: Upload, edit, and manage videos.
- Comments System: Users can comment on videos, with real-time updates.
- Likes & Dislikes: Like or dislike videos, and see counts in real-time.
- Search Functionality: Search for videos by title, tags, or categories.


##  Real-Time Tracker (Uber-like)

- Socket.io Integration: Implemented a real-time vehicle tracker.
- Live Map: Track vehicles in real-time on a map interface.
- Geolocation API: Integrated with geolocation services to show real-time locations of drivers.


##  Learning Journey

- Deep dive into Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for creating scalable backend applications.
- Learn how to integrate Socket.io for real-time communication and event-driven architecture.
- Build a robust authentication system using JWT.
- Implement RESTful APIs for the YouTube-like platform, and socket-based APIs for the real-time tracker.
- Work with Google Maps API and Geolocation API to deliver real-time tracking features.
